# Barista_Drinks_cpp
#"Abstract Factory Pattern":
  -The sorting (barista) algorithms can be used for
   any of the OrderList classes which contain a vector of 
   different Drinks (either BubbleTea or OrangeJuice)
  -This is accomplished by using inheritance and abstract
   base classes
  -The focus of this project was to use the design pattern
   and to think about the following principles while designing:
      *Rigor and formality
      *Separation of concerns
      *Modularity
      *Abstraction
      *Anticipation of Change
      *Generality
      *Incrementality
